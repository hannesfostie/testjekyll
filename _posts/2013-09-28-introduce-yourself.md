An article on [Fuck Jet Packs](http://fuckjetpacks.com/read/XOXO_is_reproducible) earlier this week about the XOXO conference contained a quote by [Andy Baio](http://twitter.com/waxpancake) that really struck home:

> Here's my theory. The conference takes you. The question of whether or not we can recreate the magic from last year all comes down to you introducing yourself to people. Our speakers aren't parachuted in, or kept in a secret back room. We're all the same here. And I know many of us are introverts, but just try. Walk up to someone, introduce yourself, and that's what is going to make this conference work. For you, and for everyone. You'll probably never be around a more accepting group of people than in this room. You should not have to be alone at XOXO.

These are values I very much believe in and want to reflect in the way I help organize [ArrrrCamp](http://arrrrcamp.be).

You, like me, might find starting a conversation is pretty hard. Let's just start with a very simple opener: &ldquo;Hi, I'm Hannes&rdquo; and the rest should come naturally.[^1] I hope you come say hi to me.

[^1]: Sorry to whoever I stole that from. I can't quite remember who said it.
