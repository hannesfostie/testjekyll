title: A missed opportunity
subtitle: What the ruby-lang.org design contest could have been
---

In the spring of 2013 [www.ruby-lang.org](http://www.ruby-lang.org) was ported to Jekyll and made open source. It was a much needed move to put the website of our beloved Ruby in the hands of the community.

The Ruby Association now created a [design contest](http://www.ruby.or.jp/en/news/20130924.html) for a visual upgrade of the site as well. I'm afraid it's a missed opportunity to achieve something bigger than just a redesign.

Reading the contest description almost feels like spec work.[^1] There's no real open source process here at all, just a request for a solution ready to be implemented. 

That's a shame considering the growing movement interested in designing open source[^2]. I believe Ruby might just be the project that could spearhead this.

Why not ask for sketches, mockups or wireframes and go from there? We could look for a couple of designers to oversee the project (to avoid having a committee making the decisions) and then let the community iterate on the result.

What do you think?
